## Motivation
After staying in the hall, we realised that we always forget groceries in the fridge or sometimes they are just hidden from sight, causing them to eventually go bad
. 
We did some research and realised that it was not uncommon as the study from 2019 revealed that 24% of households often threw away spoilt or rotten food due to these reasons and contributed to a large amount of food waste which is equivalent to everyone in Singapore throwing away 2 bowls of rice per day.
"
Thus, we had the inspiration to create this app which would have reduce the amount of food waste generated from households due to expired food forgotten and overbought.
