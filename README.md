## Project Scope
(one sentence + longer descriptive version)

## Motivation
After staying in the hall, we realised that we always forget groceries in the fridge or sometimes they are just hidden from sight, causing them to eventually go bad
. 
We did some research and realised that it was not uncommon as the study from 2019 revealed that 24% of households often threw away spoilt or rotten food due to these reasons and contributed to a large amount of food waste which is equivalent to everyone in Singapore throwing away 2 bowls of rice per day.
"
Thus, we had the inspiration to create this app which would have reduce the amount of food waste generated from households due to expired food forgotten and overbought.

**User Stories**
"As a student who shares a common fridge in hall, I want to be able to remember what items I have thrown in the fridge as they are often squeezed out of sight."

"As an environmentalist who is concerned about food wastage, I want to be able to avoid wasting food because they are forgotten."

"As a housewife who cooks often, I want to know what items are depleting and how much do I need to buy."

"As a frugal household member, I would not want my hard-earned money to be wasted by throwing away food that could have been eaten."
